        "- In most modern programming languages, including Python, integers are represented using a fixed amount of space, depending on whether they're 32-bit or 64-bit integers. This means that the number of digits in an integer is limited.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- The conversion algorithm typically involves dividing the integer by 10 repeatedly to extract each digit and then mapping these digits to their corresponding character representations. Since the number of divisions and mappings is constant and limited by the number of bits in the integer, the time complexity remains O(1).\n",

This is a result of the bounded number of digit extraction and character mapping operations, all of which are performed in constant time."
